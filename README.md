# Fashion_Recommendation_System

This project involves creating a Fashion Recommendations System using Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow's ResNet50, NumPy, and PIL. The system leverages advanced deep learning models to analyze fashion images. Specifically, it uses ResNet50 for feature extraction to obtain high-dimensional feature representations of the images. By applying nearest neighbor search algorithms, the system can identify visually similar fashion items, providing users with relevant fashion recommendations based on the visual characteristics of the items.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW 
> OBJECTIVE: 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a fashion recommendation system that leverages 
advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations for 
clothing and accessories. 
#METHODOLOGY: 
The project will involve the following key steps: 
1. File Upload and Dataset Creation: Users will have the option to upload images of 
clothing items or accessories they are interested in. These uploaded images will be saved 
in the system's dataset for future analysis and recommendation.
2. Feature Extraction: Upon uploading the images, the system will perform feature 
extraction using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
This step will extract meaningful features from the images, capturing attributes like color, 
texture, and pattern.
3. Recommendation: After feature extraction, the system will utilize similarity metrics, such 
as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, to compare the uploaded image's features with 
those of images in the dataset. Based on these comparisons, the system will recommend 
the top five images from the dataset that are most similar to the uploaded image.
4. Display Recommendations: The recommended images will be displayed to the user, 
providing them with visually similar options to explore and potentially purchase. Users 
will have the opportunity to view details of product. 
The Streamlit application serves as a Fashion Recommender System, allowing users to upload an 
image of a fashion item and receive recommendations for visually similar items from a 
precomputed dataset.
